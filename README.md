# meeting-organizer
A small meeting organizer with a text interface, Inspired by the book The Modern C++ Challenge by Marius Bancilla.

time_zones.cpp contains the main program. Enter how long until the meeting is, and the time zones of the participants, and
you will get the local time of the meeting for all participants. 

what_zones.cpp will output the names of all the timezones, so you can get a refresher on what time zones are accepted by
time_zones. 
Powered by the std::chrono library, no external dependencies are needed.
